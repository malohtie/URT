## UNITED REMOTE CODING CHALLENGE

I'm in charge to build a REST microservice that list the languages used by the top trending public repos on GitHub.

## Problem

Github API doesn't include anyway to get top 100 trending repos, they have a web page that can be found [here](https://github.com/trending) and it only return 25 repos.

## Solution

we could use scrapping and get elements from the web page but Luckily after some search i found a nice article ü•≥ that can be found [here](https://medium.com/@max.day/how-to-detect-github-trending-repo-api-using-githubarchive-heroku-mongodb-and-github-api-b3489efd9f3e).
 The solution use [Github Archive](https://www.gharchive.org) database and query all repositories which had being stared three times over all the records of the archive in one hour, after that to detect the main language of each result they fetch the repo using Github API and get the information needed.
Finally they provide an [endpoint](https://maxday.github.io/trending/data.json) that i will use in this project üòç

## Structure
